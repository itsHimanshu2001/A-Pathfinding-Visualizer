# A-Pathfinding-Visualizer

## Prerequisites 
1. pygame
2. A* algorithm working 
3. priority_queue understanding (DSA)

## About the project
This program works on A* algorithm which is used to find the shortest possible path between the starting and destination nodes. It is a visualization so we can understand the working of the algorithm in a more understandle manner. The exciting part of this program is that it works under any obstacles configuration and finds out the shortest path avoiding the obstacles between the starting and destination points.
