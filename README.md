# A-Pathfinding-Visualizer

## Prerequisites 
1. pygame
2. A* algorithm working 
3. priority_queue understanding (DSA)

## About the project
This program works on A* algorithm which is used to find the shortest possible path between the starting and destination nodes. It is a visualization so we can understand the working of the algorithm in a more understandle manner. The exciting part of this program is that it works under any obstacles configuration and finds out the shortest path avoiding the obstacles between the starting and destination points. 

## Why I chose this algorithm?
I chose this algorithm only because this uses heuristic function to reduce the search space extensively. Since we have the knowledge about other nodes and destination node beforehand, we use that knowledge to minimize the resources being used and therefore this algorithm works very fine. I have also showed the visualization of Dijkstra algorithm which is much slower and less efficient that shows how good A* algo works.
